# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented "Recent Transactions" on the Dashboard page of my budget app. Had some fun implementing and
iterating over dictionary keys and values. Fairly straightforward implementation, though. I feel like I'm past the hard part on
this project now that I have the API set up and all the database calls working.

**Thoughts:** I'm using this project as a way to learn Vim (the text editor), as well. Man is it difficult. I spend a lot of time in
insert mode, using the editor like I would any other. But there are brief moments where I use Vim to quickly 'delete inner
paragraph' or find and change something where I can see the editor's value. I'm going to spend a little more time learning and
getting comfortable with the basic. Maybe in a week or two, I'll take off the traning wheels and turn on hard mode (no arrow keys,
mouse, or backspace)

**Link to work:** 4 commits today on `budget` - https://github.com/bennett39/budget. One fun, fake code snippet `100-days.py` in this
100-days-of-code repo.
